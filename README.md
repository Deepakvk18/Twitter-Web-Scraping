# Twitter-Web-Scraping

This project was done as a part of an open source project by Omdena Kharagpur which intends to evolve the Tax Amounts(From Scalar quantity) into Tax Direction(Vector quantity(https://omdena.com/chapter-challenges/tax-allocation-manager-system/)

The library used to scrape the data from twitter is snscrape(https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) Snscrape is a scraper for social networking services (SNS). It scrapes things like user profiles, hashtags, or searches and returns the discovered items, e.g. the relevant posts.

To get the specific topics to collect data on, https://sustainability.utoronto.ca/inventories/sustainable-development-goals-sdgs-keywords/ has been chosen so as to provide a direction to collect tweets.

400+ keywords from 16 categories were used and the data collection was automated by using loops and functions.
